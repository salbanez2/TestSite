		<h2>Reading Food Labels</h2>

		<p>Look for the <strong><uppercase>contains:</uppercase></strong> section. To learn the differance between a milk allergy and lactose intolerance please click on "A Cow's Milk Allergy." If none of these ingredients are listed you can move on to the next step of reading the label!<img src=""></p>

		<p>Next we need to read through the ingredients. This is actually the most difficult part because <a href="Corn.html"><strong><!-- <uppercase> -->corn is in everything.<!-- </uppercase> --></strong></a> Please click the image below to learn more about corn. Unfortunately, corn has many names and it hides in everything because it is simply <a href="Corn.html">the worst.</a> Good luck!</p>
		
		<p>Holy Buckets. There isn't corn? Final step! Search for these ingredients!</p>

		<h2>A quick Bev Guide</h2>
		<h3>If appropriate, I <em>do</em> want a drink with that.</h3>

		<p>It is quite difficult to find drinks. Alcohol is monitored by the Department of the Treasuryâ€™s Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, not the FDA. At current, the TTB do not require ingredients to be listed. This has lead to some trial and error when it comes to finding beverages. I have learned that, in some cases, the alcohol derived from an allergen does not create an allergic reaction. Alcohol is a real grey zone for approval, so I have a few favorites that I will just list out. </p>

		<ul>
			<li>White Claw</li>
			<li>Most Ciders</li>
			<li>Wine</li>
			<li>Jameson</li>
			<li>Rum</li>
			<li>Vodka</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Mixers are difficult. Corn syrup the one of the leading ingredients in most American beverages. Please read the indredient lists, but I'll give a list of my typical mixers.</p>
		
		<ul>
				<li>Water</li>
				<li>Orange Juice</li>
				<li>Non corn syrup soda</li>
				<li>Non corn syrup Tonic Water</li>
		</ul>
