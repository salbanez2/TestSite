			<h2>Cow's Milk</h2>
			<h3>Allergic Vs. Lactose Free</h3>

			
			<p>
				When a person is allergic to milk, it means that they are allergic to the proteins within the milk. This means that <strong>caseine</strong> and <strong>whey</strong> need to be looked for. Lactose free is something very different. Lactose Free has an additive that helps people process lactose. Lactose free still contains the protiens in milk, and thus I am still allergic.

			<h2>Substitutes</h2>
			<h3>Baking</h3>

			<p>
				<strong>milk&colon;</strong> Depending the recipe, sweet or savory, I use coconut, rice, or soy milk. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Cheese&colon; Anything but Cow's Milk</strong>
				Cow's milk has a higher protein content than goat's milk or sheep's milk. So sometimes I eat goats milk with GF crackers. I also use So Delicous soy and coconut substitutes. When using these check for Almonds and Corn. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Butter&colon;</strong> Coconut Oil, soy oil, solive oil, safflower oil. This really depends on temperature and use. Please, double check that any of the oils don't contain corn. Corn usually hides in vegetable oil.
